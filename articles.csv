And a report card on the health of the U.S. economy.,"Fox News’s highly anticipated trial with Dominion Voting Systems, the voting machine maker that accused the network of spreading lies about the 2020 presidential election on its programs, ended before it began. In an unexpected twist in the courtroom on Tuesday — after jurors had been selected and opening statements delayed — Fox News agreed to a $787.5 million settlement. Dominion had been seeking $1.6 billion in damages. But even at less than half that amount, the settlement is still one of the largest ever in a defamation case. Though Fox did not apologize for its falsehoods, the company acknowledged in a statement that “certain claims” it made about Dominion were false. And Fox may face more consequences; the cable news network remains entangled in multiple legal battles, including a defamation suit from another election technology company, Smartmatic, which is seeking an even larger amount: $2.7 billion.

The Secret Is in the Cemetery.,There’s comfort and wisdom to be found in the eerie poetry of gravestones.,"For most of my life, I’ve found cemeteries to be foreboding places, best left to funeral processions and gravediggers. But seven years ago I met a man named Steve Baldwin who changed my thinking on the matter. Then about 60, Baldwin was known to some around New York City as the Parrot Guy, because for almost two decades he has kept unofficial watch over the city’s South American green monk parakeets. I first contacted Baldwin while working on a story about the history of the parrots in New York: According to legend, in the 1960s, they had escaped from a shipping crate at J.F.K. and then later began nesting atop utility poles and beneath overpasses, playing a cat-and-mouse game with city authorities bent on eliminating them from public land. When I asked him if he’d be willing to meet, he replied, “I’d suggest Green-Wood Cemetery.” I had little choice. The graveyard, being a protected space, was one of the few places in the city the birds could live."

I love how easy it is: ingredients on tray, tray in oven, leave there to cook. I love how few dishes there are to wash and how much the flavor of everything benefits from the exchange of one ingredient with another. I love that my kids love a tray bake: empowered, through choosing for themselves what they’re going to reach for, to be somehow more experimental and relaxed than they might be otherwise."

564,Recipes,‘This Is the Best Chicken I’ve Ever Had’,A dash of gin and a smattering of fried sage make these sautéed chicken breasts more than the usual weeknight dinner.,"When Amy Thielen was a child, she was a gabber: someone who needed to verbalize the thoughts out of her head before they overwhelmed her. To “pour the foam off,” as she put it. While her mother cooked at the stovetop, the young Thielen sat on a yellow vinyl-padded swivel stool at the kitchen island, twirling and talking her mother’s ear off about seventh grade. This proximity to the “action” of cooking, a sort of learning by absorption, would form the foundation of Thielen’s culinary education as she moved through her life later as a restaurant line cook and cookbook author. Details like how to cut the mushrooms and when to flip the chicken, and what to do with the fond that collects on the bottom of the pan (make a sauce, of course). “It was like I could be watching Food Network,” she said to me over the phone, “but it was live.”"

591,Recipes,"When Recipes Are Not Recipes, but Ideas","  OVER the years, among the many major culinary trends, two polar-opposite positions have evolved in the recipe-writing business. One sort of food writer assumes that the cook wants and needs to be told what to do in a prescriptive fashion -- make it work, make it beautiful. But from the opposite camp come recipes aimed at some presumably smaller number of cooks who are confident enough and experienced enough to search out the cooking tutors who will simply show them the way and set them free.   Elizabeth David, the British food writer, was renowned for being a cookbook author in the latter camp (the American chef Anne Rosenzweig once said of David's writing: ""Recipes were not recipes; they were ideas""). More recently, there have been many other strong examples of the approach. Among contemporary books, Shirley King's ""Fish: The Basics"" comes to mind for its willingness to give direction and then trust the cook to do something with it.","OVER the years, among the many major culinary trends, two polar-opposite positions have evolved in the recipe-writing business.

But for decades, his avocation has been cooking. “Deep Flavors,” his hefty new cookbook, is a compendium of his own recipes (sometimes adapted from others) all written for a kosher kitchen. He approaches the kitchen with the same attention to detail that he might apply to a tax file or brief. It’s worth reading the copious text as he explains how his recipes evolved, sometimes with advice he picked up from figures like Julia Child, Mark Bittman and Barbara Kafka. He disdains shortcuts and treasures fresh and unprocessed high-quality ingredients. Pay attention to his advice about preparing ingredients before starting a recipe, like blanching basil for pesto to keep the color. The recipes are Jewish, Southern (he lives in Texas), Middle Eastern and more, tweaked, when necessary, for a Jewish or kosher home. His brownies are winners, as is his Indian-style grilled chicken with a spiced nondairy yogurt. Mr. Horwitz seems to have quite a sweet tooth, shown in the sugar he adds to several recipes, most notably his stuffed cabbage."

702,Recipes,RECIPES WITH A PAST,"  or years, we believed that the food-news column of The New York Times dated back to about January 1948. Two of the first recipes created for the newspaper food section in that month were for a macaroni custard pie and a plain custard.   To our astonishment, while recently doing research through issues dating back to 1880, we learned that more than 100 years ago there was, indeed, a food column with recipes listed under ''receipts.'' To our great pleasure, we discovered that many of the recipes had a ring of sophistication. For example, one could find a recipe for sauerbraten and a mutton dish called ''schislih'' (shashlik), listed as ''a Caucasian dish given to the writer by Alexandre Dumas, pere.''

And even then it took them more than a few years to get it right. In 1968, Craig Claiborne, then The Times's food editor, published a recipe for a refreshing, straightforward version from a home cook named Manola Drozdoski that was made with tomatoes, cucumbers, green pepper, garlic and the rest, which Claiborne called ""Málaga Gazpacho."" The thought was a nice tribute to an obscure city in southern Spain, except that Málaga (and its region, Andalusia) doesn't have just one version of gazpacho but many -- some made with egg, others with fish, potato and mayonnaise.

823,Recipes,Warning! This is Not a Recipe.,"  What you see below appears to be a recipe.    But it is not a recipe.    It is a tool for making a political statement.   The arena? The holiday party.   You have cooked up something special, let's say your famous, lighter-than-air Solstice cookies. It's the pride of your kitchen, a secret recipe you've honed to perfection. You bring a batch to a party and your fellow-revelers are in hog heaven. Everything is merry until you find yourself cornered by someone preaching Recipe Socialism: share your secret or be branded Capitalist Running Dog.   Now, you mustn't admit that you don't want to give away your recipe because it's    yours    and you're entitled to it. That smacks of respect for private property and the subversive conceit that you deserve what you earn by the sweat of your brow. But if you try to be honest, your fellow traveler friend (eager to lay hands on undeserved gain) is apt to accuse you of lacking the holiday spirit.   Don't argue. Just clip out the following recipe (note how convincingly we've matched the layout of recipes in The Living Section), and present it to the pastry panhandler. Holiday Puffs   Total time: 25 minutes  1 egg  1/2 cup buttermilk (or 1/4 cup milk mixed with 1/4 cup vinegar)  5 teaspoons baking soda  1/2 teaspoon vanilla  1 cup lemon juice (fresh is best)  1/2 cup sugar  3/8 cup all-purpose flour   1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Butter a cookie sheet.   2. In a small bowl or 2-cup measuring cup, beat the egg until foamy.   3. Add the buttermilk and the vanilla and blend well.   4. Add the baking soda, one teaspoon at a time, sprinkling it in and beating until the mixture is smooth and the consistency of light cream.   5. Add the lemon juice all at once. Stir gently until blended, but do not beat (it is important not to allow air to get trapped in the mixture).   6. Sift the sugar and the flour together in a small bowl and add it to the egg mixture a teaspoon at a time. Stir until just moistened.   7. Drop the batter by tablespoonfuls, one inch apart, onto the buttered cookie sheet.   8. Bake for 12 minutes or until golden. Serve hot.     Yield: 12 servings     Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 62 calories, 1 gram fat, 10 milligrams cholesterol, 2 milligrams sodium, 4 grams protein, 4 grams carbohydrate.    Then rest secure in the knowledge that when your pantry pinko reaches Step 5, about a gallon of lemon-egg foam will gush out of the measuring cup and inundate the kitchen counter. It's harmless, just lemon juice liberating the carbonate radical of the sodium bicarbonate to produce a cascade of CO2 bubbles -- no fires and, regrettably, no explosions. But plenty messy and more than enough to make Chef Share-the-Wealth crazy.   A ruling-class lackey like yourself may want to photocopy and distribute this recipe to all the bleeding hearts at the party. Or add a touch of verisimilitude by writing it out on a file card, dipping it in weak tea to age the paper and leaving it out as freeloader flypaper. And if nobody's trying to mooch a recipe from you, no need to feel left out. Be an anarchist: slip the recipe into someone else's fax machine (it's a virus) and use the auto dialer to send little bundles of holiday chaos all 'round the world.

This can be a matter of chance. But the likelihood increases if you keep the heat relatively high, turning it down only when you smell a little scorching.

And apartment kitchens are often cramped and lacking in natural light and views. These are not the sorts of kitchens you will find in “The Kitchen Bible: Designing the Perfect Culinary Space” (Images Publishing; $45), by Barbara Ballinger, Margaret Crane and Jennifer Gilmer, a kitchen designer of three decades. The aspirational spaces pictured here, many designed by Ms. Gilmer, are mostly amply sized, outfitted with the latest appliances and carefully propped for their close-ups. But the book also clearly lays out the steps involved in a kitchen redo. Although geared more toward those who will be working with a kitchen designer than those tackling makeovers themselves, the book offers advice on things like hanging stove hoods that is useful for do-it-yourselfers, too."

844,Recipes,Master Shortbread Recipe,,"If you use half a pound of butter in a batch of cookies, it becomes “short” — because “short” means, historically, pastry with a high percentage of fat. Thus shortbread cookies are — when correctly made — rich, crumbly and impossible to resist. In their simplest form, they taste mostly of sweet and sweetened butter, so the best butter you can lay your hands on will make a difference here. I like that side-of-the-tongue tingling presence of saltiness, and so I tend to use a little more salt than is strictly necessary, hence the range in the recipe."

And there is little chance of a film being made of his culinary obsessions unless Barbra Streisand and Nick Nolte, who starred in the screen version of his novel ""The Prince of Tides,"" have been hankering to make Pot Likker Soup (balm to a Southerner's nerves, Mr. Conroy writes).

Mr. Peddie tosses out numbers, citing console sales at more than 74 million units ""over several years,"" compared to 186 million gaming PCs shipped from mid-2005 to the present.

Mr. Peddie also touts the increased utility of a computer over a game console, where one ""can do real work, not just some feeble web browsing in a closed garden.''  Perception is partly to blame, he says: ""Part of the problem is that PC gaming has been associated with first-person shooters, and the PC gamer has been depicted as some fat white boy with zits and an enlarged right hand wrist muscle...

Later on Tuesday, Mr. Perlman, a Silicon Valley veteran who is a former principal scientist at Apple and the founder of WebTV, will unveil his new company, OnLive, which he says has the potential to radically transform the $46 billion worldwide video game market.  When it begins operations later this year, OnLive will offer subscribers a selection of video games that are hosted online and can be played on at any time, on any television or computer — Macintosh or PC — including low-cost computers without sophisticated graphics chips. (To play on the TV, people will need a small, hand-size micro-console, which OnLive says it may give away free.)  Rapid-fire shoot-em-ups like Electronic Arts' Crysis, normally playable only by people with high-end gaming computers, will be available to everyone, Mr. Perlman says, and ""it will feel like the games are being played locally.""  Game publishers including EA, Take Two Interactive, Warner Brothers, THQ and Eidos, among others, have signed on to provide games, and because of the flexibility that comes with hosting titles online, they can experiment with incentives, like free trials, and new business models, like game rentals.   Mr. Perlman says he has been quietly working on OnLive for the last seven years, trying to perfect the video compression algorithms. The company, which was spun out of Rearden, his technology incubator, now has 100 employees in Palo Alto and San Francisco and around 100 patents related to cloud-based gaming.  If it works -- and it seems as if that will heavily depend on whether the technology provides a satisfying, lag-free experience for the most intense games -- Mr. Perlman says it will undermine the $20 billion market for hardware like Xbox, PlayStation and Wii consoles.  He also says hosting games in the cloud can cut out video game retailers, who are punishing the profit margins for video game publishers, and destroy piracy and the secondary market for used games. Cloud-based gaming could also conceivably relieve consumers from ever having to upgrade their gaming hardware again.  But gamers will no doubt reserve judgment until they are playing Crysis against a stranger across the country on a lower-end machine. OnLive will formally introduce itself Tuesday night at the Game Developer's Conference that is being held this week in San Francisco.  "
